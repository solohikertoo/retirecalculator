    <h3>Inflation:</h3>
    <p>Generally the increase in wages does not keep up with cost of living, so there are
    two inflation rates: one for cost of living and one for wages.</p>
    <p><span class="col1">Cost of Living Inflation Rate (%):</span>
       <span class="col2"><input type="number" id="cost-inflation" min="0" value = 3.5></span>

       <input type="number" id="wage-inflation" min="0" value = 2.0></p>

    <div id="invest-return">
    <h3>Investment returns:</h3>
    <p>Investment style changes over time, typically being more aggressive when you are younger
    and more conservative when you are older. So there are two investment return rates: one for 
    younger and one for older, and an age at which the rate changes from one to the other. </p>
    <p><span class="col1">Younger Investment Return (%): </span>
       <span class="col2"><input type="number" id="young-invest-return" min="0" value = 7.0></span>
       <span class="col1">Older Investment Return (%): </span>
       <input type="number" id="old-invest-return" min="0" value = 5.0> </p>

    <h3>Planned Yearly Contribution To Retirement Savings (in todays dollars):</h3>
    <p>The amount you contribute to retirement savings per year will change over time. 
    You might assume you are making more money at a certain age and will contribute more during those

    contributions are broken into intervals. Each interval has a starting age, ending age, and 
    yearly amount of contribution.</p>
